# Highlights

The *15.10 Alpha* release is the first official release for the reference software platform project. It incorporates reference platform builds for both HiKey (Debian and AOSP) and Dragonboard410c (Debian).

While the release supports many of the available hardware features for both Hikey and Dragonboard410c, it is in *ALPHA* state (used as a starting point for the reference software platform project), so bugs are expected. For a better user experience, please use the previous releases available at https://builds.96boards.org/releases/dragonboard410c/ and https://builds.96boards.org/releases/hikey/.

   - OpenJDK 8 included by default
   - 96Boards artworks and default settings
