# IoT Reference Platform

The IoT reference platformâ€™s goal is to provide an end to end open source secure pipeline from gateway devices to endpoints. For the deeply embedded use cases, a Zephyr RTOS baseline is provided to enable a series of hardware platforms, which ships with a rich developer SDK. The gateway is a variant of the Consumer reference platform based on Debian, leveraging the latest in cloud and container technology. Secure updates are not a mere afterthought, instead this software stack has been designed with security and maintainability in mind from day one.

**Features:**

- Zephyr RTOS with SDK for endpoints
- Open Boot Firmware for endpoints
- Debian builds for gateways
- Secure update pipeline for all devices
