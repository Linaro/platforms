# 17.08 Release Notes - Linaro Enterprise Reference Platform

The goal of the Linaro Enterprise Reference Platform is to provide a fully tested, end to end, documented, open source implementation for ARM based Enterprise servers. The Reference Platform includes boot firmware, kernel, a community supported userspace and additional relevant open source projects. The Linaro Enterprise Reference Platform is built and tested on Linaro Enterprise Group members hardware and the Linaro Developer Cloud.
